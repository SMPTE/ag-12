    <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
<pre>
This meeting is being conducted in accordance with the SMPTE Policies and Governance Documents, 
which can be found on the SMPTE website (<a>https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-and-governance</a>). 
Your participation, whether as a member or guest, is governed by these provisions. Your continued 
attendance at this meeting indicates that you understand and are complying with these documents.

Your attention is particularly directed to both the Code of Conduct in the Membership Operations 
Manual and to the intellectual property section in the Standards Operations Manual. The latter 
requires attendees to inform the Technology Committee chair of personal knowledge of any claims 
under any issued patent or any patent application that likely would be infringed by an implementation 
of any document under consideration by this Committee.

Furthermore, attendees must keep the meeting proceedings confidential, must not record the proceedings,
and must not communicate the meeting proceedings or any of its documented contents to external parties,
including the press, without the approval of the Standards Vice President.
